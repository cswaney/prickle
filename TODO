(1) Add support for trading halts (global).
  - Process trading halts in System messages.
  - If halt occurs, then writing = False.
  - If resume occurs, then writing = True.
(2) Add support for trading halts (individual).
  - Process the trading halts in Stock-Action messages.
  - Keep a list of halted stocks.
  - If halt occurs, do not proceed past message completion.
  - An elegant way to deal with this is to remove the stock from the namelist
    when a halt occurs, and then append it back when it resumes.
(3) Write print statements to log file at fout location.
  - Make this an option (e.g. log=True).


- Replace message shares can change.
- Docstrings.
- Cross-trade messae handling.
- Database should completely write over previous database?
  - If you try to write over existing with same name you will get an error because the size of the datasets don't agree. You need to delete the old dataset, then initialize the new one.
